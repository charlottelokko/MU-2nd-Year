# MU-2nd-Year
This contains some work from 2nd Year 

Algorithms and Data structures 1 contains Hackerank style coding questions I completed while studying for the module. 

The assignment 3 in my web infomation processing folder was my project for that module. We had to design an app to learn hiragana incorporating tables, gifs, sounds, images a self filling quiz. I never got to complete this project to the desired brief unfortunately.
